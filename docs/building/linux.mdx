## Requirements

### Machine Specifications

- Disk Space: At least 40GB of free disk space.
- Operating System: The latest version of Ubuntu.

### Required Tools

- [git](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
- [deno](https://deno.com/)

### Installation steps

1. Install Deno: 
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone the Floorp repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/Floorp
cd Floorp
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
deno install
```

4. Build Floorp:
```bash
deno task dev
```

First run downloads the binary from GitHub Actions. A browser will launch and automatically reload when you change the source code (using hot reload or HMR if supported), so you won't need to restart.

Congratulations! You have successfully built Floorp!

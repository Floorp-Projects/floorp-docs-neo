We cannot provide support if a build fails.
Please understand this before proceeding with the following steps.

## Requirements

### Machine Specifications

- **Memory:** Minimum 4GB RAM, 8GB+ recommended.
- **Disk Space:** At least 40GB of free disk space.
- **Operating System:** The latest version of macOS.

### Required Tools

- [git](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
- [deno](https://deno.com/)

## Installation steps

1. Install Deno:

```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install deno

# Or using curl:
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone the Floorp repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/Floorp
cd Floorp
```

3. Set up GitHub Token:

GITHUB_TOKEN is required to download artifacts from GitHub Actions.

Choose one of the following methods:

**Option 1: Using .env file (recommended)**
Create a `.env` file in the repository root and add:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

**Option 2: Using environment variable**

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

**How to create a GitHub Token:**

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select the `public_repo` scope (or `repo` for private repositories)
4. Copy the generated token and set it as described above

5. Install dependencies:

```bash
deno install
```

6. Build Floorp:

```bash
deno task feles-build dev
```

A browser will launch and automatically reload when you change the source code (using hot reload or HMR if supported), so you won't need to restart.

Congratulations! You have successfully built Floorp!

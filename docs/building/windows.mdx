## Installation steps

1. Install Deno: 
```bash
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

2. Install PowerShell 7 or later:
```bash
# Using Winget (recommended)
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget

# Or download from the Github releases page:

```

2. Clone the Floorp repository:

cd Floorp

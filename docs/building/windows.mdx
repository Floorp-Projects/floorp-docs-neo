## Requirements

### Machine Specifications

- Memory: Minimum 4GB RAM, 8GB+ recommended.
- Disk Space: At least 40GB of free disk space.
- Operating System: The latest version of Windows.

### Required Tools

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
- [deno](https://deno.com/)

## Installation steps

1. Install Deno: 
```bash
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

2. Install PowerShell 7 or later:
```bash
# Using Winget (recommended)
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget

# Or download from the Github releases page:
# https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases
```

3. Clone the Floorp repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/Floorp
cd Floorp
```
4. Download `floorp-windows-x86_64-moz-artifact.zip` from the latest successful Daily Runtime Build on the [Floorp-runtime Actions page](https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/Floorp-runtime/actions) and place it in the root of the cloned repository.

5. Install dependencies:
```bash
deno install
```

6. Build Floorp:
```bash
deno task feles-build dev
```

A browser will launch and automatically reload when you change the source code (using hot reload or HMR if supported), so you won't need to restart.

Congratulations! You have successfully built Floorp!

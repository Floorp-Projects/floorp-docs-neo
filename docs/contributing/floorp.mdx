Thank you for your interest in improving Floorp!  
This page outlines the ways you can contribute to Floorp's development and growth.

The easiest way to contribute is simply to use Floorp.

## Submit an Issue

If you encounter any bugs, please report them on GitHub.  
We rely on user feedback to make improvements and ensure a better experience.

Before submitting an issue, please review our [Issue Submission Checklist](/docs/other/issue-checklist).

## Contribute Code

If you have programming experience, you're welcome to enhance Floorp’s features or fix bugs directly.

The main development takes place in the `main` branch of the [Floorp repository](https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/Floorp).\
Please check GitHub for more information.

## Improve Translations

Floorp’s internationalization relies on the efforts of multilingual contributors.

### Improve Browser Localization

Please join the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/floorp-browser) for browser  translations.

If you're looking to improve American English localization, please check [this](https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/f18n-central#improving-the-english-us-localization).

### Improve Other Localization

- The language files for the **official website (floorp.app)** are located in `/tree/main/public/locales` in [web-v3](https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/web-v3).

- The non-English language files for **these documents (docs.floorp.app)** are located in `/tree/dev/i18n/[yourLang]/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current` in [floorp-docs-neo](https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/floorp-docs-neo). The English language files are located in `/tree/dev/docs`.

  In order for a document to appear on the website, it must also be in English. Adding only non-English documents will not display them on the website.

  Please check [this page](/docs/contributing/floorp-docs) for more information.

### About Vertical Tab Bar in Floorp 12 and Later

The vertical tabs previously implemented by Floorp are no longer available in version 12 and later.\
This change occurred because Mozilla, Floorp's upstream provider, has implemented vertical tabs in Firefox, eliminating the need for separate maintenance by Floorp.\
To use vertical tabs going forward, we recommend using Firefox's implementation.

Here is how Firefox appears with vertical tabs enabled:

### Differences Between Floorp and Firefox Vertical Tabs

There are several differences between the vertical tabs implemented in Firefox and those in Floorp.\
Please note that Firefox's vertical tabs operate in the same location as the sidebar, so they are not specifically designed to always display tabs.

While Floorp strives to ensure sidebar compatibility with Firefox, some conflicts may still occur.

Currently, vertical tabs can be enabled via "Customize Sidebar" with `Firefox Settings > Show Sidebar` enabled.

### Browsing with Just Your Mouse

Since Floorp 12, the mouse gesture feature allows you to perform various browser actions simply by moving your mouse.

Typically, browsers are operated by clicking buttons or text on the UI. Experienced users may also use keyboard shortcuts.\
However, since web browsing is often done with a mouse, wouldn't it be convenient to perform browser actions using only the mouse?\
The mouse gesture feature in Floorp was developed to meet this need.

Unlike traditional UI operations or keyboard shortcuts, which require finding buttons or pressing multiple keys, mouse gestures let you quickly perform actions anywhere on the page using just the mouse.

### How to Use Mouse Gestures

Mouse Gestures are enabled by default. You can disable them via "Floorp Hub" > "Mouse Gestures".

By default, basic actions such as `Back`, `Forward`, and `Reload` are registered.\
For example, holding the right mouse button and moving left will go back to the previous page. Holding the right mouse button and moving up then down will reload the page.

While performing a gesture, the mouse trail is displayed. When you release the button with the action name shown, the action is executed.

### Customizing Mouse Gestures

You can freely customize both the gestures and the actions they perform. Set up your favorite gestures to create a comfortable browsing experience.

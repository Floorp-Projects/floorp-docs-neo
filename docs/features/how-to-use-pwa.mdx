### Keep Your Favorite Websites at Hand

The Windows version of Floorp supports Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).\
With PWAs, you can install websites on your PC and use them just like desktop applications. This makes it easy to open frequently used sites, such as video platforms or social networks, as if they were appsâ€”helping to improve your workflow. Regular websites can also be installed with just a few clicks.

Installed websites can be pinned to the taskbar or launched from the Start menu, just like other apps.\
At the same time, some Firefox ADD-ONS available in the regular browser can also be used, creating a unique experience that feels "like an app, but also like a browser."

### How to Use Web Apps

:::warning

**Currently, web apps are only supported on the Windows version.** They may work partially on Linux and macOS, but full functionality is not guaranteed.

Also, at this time, Floorp must be running in order for Web Apps to work. We are considering improvements to this behavior.

:::

You can enable the Web App feature in "Floorp Hub" > "Web Apps".\
On this page, you can toggle whether to show a Toolbar in Web App windows, as well as uninstall installed Web Apps.

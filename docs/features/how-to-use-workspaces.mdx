### What are Workspace Features?

Workspace features are functions for grouping and managing tabs.
For example, if you create a workspace named "Shopping", all tabs within that workspace belong to the "Shopping" group.
Similarly, if you create another workspace named "Blog", all tabs within that workspace belong to the "Blog" group.

Also, only one workspace can be displayed in a window at a time.

By grouping tabs in this way, the number of visible tabs decreases, making the visual appearance cleaner and improving browsing efficiency.
However, workspaces that are not visible remain open in the background, so you won't lose any data you've entered.

### How to Use Workspace Features

<img src={ToolBarButton} height="350px" alt="How to use workspace features" style={{margin: "10px 0"}}/>

To use workspace features, click the toolbar button shown in the image. After that, a panel for managing workspaces will appear.

By default, a workspace named "New Workspace (0)" is created. The highlighted workspace is the currently open workspace.

To create a new workspace, click the "Create New Workspace..." button.

To rename or customize a workspace, right-click on the workspace button and select "Manage Workspace".
You can also customize the currently open workspace by clicking the "âš™" icon in the bottom right corner.

From Floorp 12 onwards, Floorp workspaces are shared between windows. Additionally, a sync feature using Ablaze Accounts is planned to be added in the future.

### About Workspace Container Features

This feature, introduced in [Floorp 11.4.0](https://blog.ablaze.one/3510/2023-09-22/), allows you to apply Firefox's container feature to open workspaces in advance.

As explained in "How to Use Workspace Features", right-click on the workspace button and select "Manage Workspace".
You can select a container tab from the "Container Tab" select box in the management dialog.

For information about container tabs, please refer to [this official Mozilla document](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers#firefox).

### Customizing Workspace Features

Floorp provides various customization options to make workspace features more convenient to use. Here are some of these options:

- Close popup when selecting a workspace

    This is enabled by default. It sets whether to close the popup when selecting a workspace.

- Display workspace name next to the toolbar button

    This is enabled by default. It sets whether to display the workspace name next to the workspace toolbar button.

- Manage workspaces in the panel sidebar

    This is disabled by default. It sets whether to manage workspaces in the panel sidebar.
    When this feature is enabled, you can manage workspaces only on the panel sidebar. You won't be able to manage workspaces using the toolbar button.

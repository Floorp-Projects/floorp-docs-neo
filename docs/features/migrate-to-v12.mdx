### Overview of Floorp 12

Floorp 12 has been completely rewritten, discarding all previous codebase and rebuilding with new foundation.
This represents a fundamentally different browser that uses a new codebase instead of the legacy system maintained from Floorp 8 through Floorp 11.

All features from settings to workspaces and Progressive Web Apps (PWA) have been redesigned to create a more sophisticated browser.

### About Feature Changes

Please check our blog for the latest info. The release notes for Floorp 12 Release Candidate 1 are [here](https://blog.floorp.app/release/12.0.0-RC1.html).

#### Settings

The settings page has been reorganized. The method of adding Floorp settings to Firefox settings that continued through Floorp 11 has been discontinued.
With this update, Firefox settings and Floorp settings are completely separated, adopting a method to access Floorp settings through the Firefox settings page.

The redesigned settings page includes:

- Homepage configuration
- Workspace customization
- Keyboard shortcut management
- Web app management
- Profile and account controls
- About Floorp information

The homepage is displayed when opening Floorp settings. This feature, which didn't exist in Floorp 11, displays information about Floorp, setup status, and privacy-related information.\
Future updates will integrate Ablaze Account management for syncing notes and workspaces when logged in.

The updated settings page now provides better support documentation and user guidance.

New settings page:
<img src={Settings} width="100%" alt="Redesigned settings interface" />

#### Workspaces

Workspaces are now shared across all windows.
Unlike Floorp 11's window-specific implementation that resembled tab groups,\
Floorp 12 uses a unified workspace system similar to [Vivaldi Browser](https://vivaldi.com).

The workspace management interface no longer uses Firefox's native dialogs, allowing centralized name changes and configuration.

<hr />

#### Split View

No significant changes.

<hr />

#### Panel Sidebar (Floorp's Sidebar)

The Browser Manager Sidebar has been renamed in Floorp 12.

<hr />

#### Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

Not implemented.

### How to Migrate to Floorp 12

There is currently no direct migration path from Floorp 11 to Floorp 12 due to compatibility differences.

For risk-averse users:
1. Maintain Floorp 11 until Firefox ESR 128 support ends
2. Backup your Floorp 11 profile before testing Floorp 12
3. Install Floorp 12 separately to preserve your stable environment

For early adopters:
1. Back up your Floorp 11 profile
2. Perform clean Floorp 12 installation
3. Manually migrate essential settings
4. Maintain ability to revert to Floorp 11

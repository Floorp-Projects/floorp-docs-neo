## Temporary Unavailability Notice

The Split View feature, which was implemented by Floorp, is currently unavailable as of version 12.5.1 and later due to the update to Firefox 145.

### Reason for Unavailability

Mozilla has announced plans to implement a native split view feature in Firefox 146 and later versions. As a result, Floorp's custom implementation of this feature has been temporarily disabled to avoid conflicts with the upcoming native implementation.

### Expected Availability

If everything proceeds as planned, the split view functionality is expected to become available again within approximately one month through Firefox's native implementation.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to integrate the new native split view feature once it becomes available in Firefox.

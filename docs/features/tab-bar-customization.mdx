## Tab Bar Layout

#### Available Tab Bar Styles

- Default (Horizontal Tab Bar)

This is the horizontal tab bar used in most browsers. It functions exactly the same as Firefox's default.

- Multi-row Tab Bar

Displays the tab bar in multiple rows. When this tab bar is selected, Floorp displays tabs vertically in a compact manner and shows a second row when it detects that the number of tabs has increased.
The multi-row option also provides an option to limit the number of rows displayed.

:::info
Vertical tabs implemented by Floorp are no longer available from Floorp 12 onwards.

**Instead, you can use the vertical tabs implemented in Firefox.**

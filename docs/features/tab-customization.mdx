### Tab Customization

#### Scrolling

Configure whether to switch tabs by scrolling and how scrolling behaves.
- Switch tabs by scrolling

    When this option is enabled, tabs will switch when scrolled.
    By default, this is disabled, and instead, the tab bar will scroll when overflow occurs.

- Reverse tab scrolling

    When this option is enabled, tab scrolling direction will be reversed.
    This is disabled by default. It is ignored if the "Switch tabs by scrolling" option is disabled.

- Loop tab scrolling

    When this option is enabled, scrolling will loop back to the first tab after reaching the last tab.
    This is disabled by default. It is ignored if the "Switch tabs by scrolling" option is disabled.

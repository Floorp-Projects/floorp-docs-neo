### What is DRM?

DRM (Digital Rights Management) is a copyright protection mechanism. When you try to play content protected by DRM, the website checks if the necessary DRM software is available. Most browsers use [Widevine](https://www.widevine.com/), a DRM technology developed by Google.

Floorp doesn't have a Widevine license. Therefore, DRM-protected videos or music cannot be played in Floorp.

### Why Floorp Doesn't Have a License

Acquiring a license requires Floorp developers to pay at least 5000 USD to DRM providers.

Floorp is developed by a community of mainly Japanese software developers. This issue won't be resolved as the community is not commercially oriented.

### How to Play DRM-Protected Content

You can use major browsers like Firefox or Chrome, which have the necessary licenses.

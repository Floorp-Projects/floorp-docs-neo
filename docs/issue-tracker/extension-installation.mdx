### Some Extensions Cannot Be Installed on Floorp

Currently, Floorp is based on Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) 115. As of May 14, 2024, the latest Firefox version is 125.

Since Floorp uses an older Firefox base, it may lack some features found in the latest version. This can cause compatibility issues with certain Firefox extensions that rely on these newer features.

There is an option to disable the extension compatibility check. However, this is not recommended and is not officially supported.

To disable the compatibility check, navigate to:\
`General` -> `Browsing` -> `Do not check for compartibility with add-ons`

If you need to use these extensions, please consider using Firefox.

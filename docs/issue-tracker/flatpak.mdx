### Issue Description

Since Flatpak has its own isolated environment, the sandbox, the Flatpak version of Floorp may encounter bugs that do not occur in the tarball version.

When submitting issues for the Flatpak version, please check if they also occur in the tarball version. Information on whether the issue occurs “in both tarball and Flatpak” or “Flatpak only” is very helpful for resolving your problems.

:::caution
We currently do not have any plans to release a mobile version of Floorp.
:::

### Why No Plans for Mobile?
Our team lacks the time and resources to develop Android and iOS versions. Additionally, supporting mobile platforms would significantly increase our costs.

### Code Structure
Although Firefox, the base of Floorp, uses the Gecko rendering engine for both mobile and desktop versions, there are significant differences in the browser frontends. These differences prevent most of Floorp's codebase from being reused across platforms.

### Cost Concerns
Our team is dedicated to maintaining the desktop version of Floorp. Unfortunately, due to limited resources and our reliance on donations (without a current profit model), developing a mobile version is not feasible.

### What's Next?
If we establish a sustainable profit model, we might consider developing Floorp Mobile in the future.

Please note there are currently no plans for Floorp Mobile. Thank you for your understanding.

:::caution
Floorp Portable Version cannot Be Set as the Default Browser in Windows.
:::

The portable version of Floorp is intentionally designed not to be set as the default browser.

### Why cannot It Be Set as Default?
In Windows, browsers are typically registered through an installer, allowing them to be set as the default browser. Since the portable version of Floorp does not include an installer, it lacks the necessary registration to be selected as the default browser.

### Alternative Solutions
While we do not endorse this feature, you can use third-party software that registers portable versions of software as the default. Use such software at your own risk.

Additionally, there is a [workaround](https://docs.floorp.app/en/others/floorp-portable-default-browser/) using .bat script.

Please refer to the related issue for more details.

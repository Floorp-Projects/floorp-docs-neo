#### User Agent Changer Doesn't Work Properly

The User Agent Changer in Firefox (Floorp) is made intentionally simple. There is no mechanism to prevent websites from detecting the actual browser you are using.

#### How to Fix UA-Related Problems

The User Agent changer is not perfect, so it is generally recommended not to use it. However, if you choose to use the User Agent changer, you can install add-ons that provide this functionality and exclude websites where problems occur.

## Workspaces Are Being Reset

Currently, workspaces are saved on a per-window basis. This means that **if you wish to retain your workspace, do not close the browser windows**.

## Restoring Closed Workspaces
If a workspace is accidentally closed, it can be restored by navigating to:

**History > Recently Closed Windows**

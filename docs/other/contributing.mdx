title: Floorp Docs Contribution Guidelines
---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Floorp's documentation!\
 Before contributing, please review existing content and check for open issues to avoid duplication.

## Contribution Types

### Adding Content
Before writing anything new, first check if the topic already exists in our documentation. If it does, consider improving the existing content instead of creating duplicates. 
When adding new documentation, write it in a way that both actual users and developers would naturally understand.

### Fixing Issues
If you spot something wrong in the documentation, you can either report it by opening a new issue where you clearly describe what's incorrect, or better yet - fix it yourself and submit the correction directly through a pull request. 
When you do submit fixes, make sure to mention any related issues so we can connect the dots.

To do this: 
1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/floorp-docs-neo/issues/new/choose) describing the problem, or
2. Submit a pull request with the fix

### Translations
We value translations that balances natural readability with technical precision. 

Translation requirements:
- **Natural Adaptation**: Translations should read as if originally written in the target language, adapting sentence structures appropriately. Avoid direct word-for-word translations when they would sound unnatural.

- **Technical Consistency**: All browser-specific terminology (e.g., "Extensions", "Workspaces", "Sidebar") must use official translations where they exist. For new/untranslated terms, maintain consistency throughout all documentation.

- **Structure Alignment**: Translated pages must follow the structure of the original English files.


Contribution process:
1. Check for existing translations (e.g., `docs/en/`)
2. For new languages, create folder using correct [ISO 639-1](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) code
3. Submit your changes via pull request

**Important:** Translations must be actively maintained. If a language has no updates or activity for 5+ months, and no notice was provided, it may be removed.

### Potential Blocking by Security Software

When launching Floorp, you may encounter warnings from Windows Defender or other security software.

As long as you download Floorp through official channels, these warnings are false positives. Floorp has made its source code and build environment fully available on GitHub, allowing anyone to audit its contents.

Itâ€™s not uncommon for software from smaller communities to be mistakenly identified as malicious software.

### If a Warning Appears

It is extremely difficult to completely prevent false positives. If you encounter what seems to be a false positive, please contact the support service of your security software.

### Related Services

Windows Defender, Bitdefender, Norton 360, McAfee, Kaspersky, etc.

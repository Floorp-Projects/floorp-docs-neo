When accessing the Floorp settings, you might notice a notification at the top stating, "Floorp is being managed by your organization." This is standard browser behavior in certain installation scenarios.

## Why Does This Notification Appear?
This notification appears when Floorp has been installed or updated through a package manager, such as Flatpak. It indicates that Floorp is being managed and updated by the package manager, rather than using the browser’s built-in auto-update feature.

In essence, the package manager takes control of Floorp’s updates, and as a result, the browser flags that it’s being managed externally.

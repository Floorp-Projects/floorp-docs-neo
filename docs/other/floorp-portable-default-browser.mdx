**While Windows doesn't natively support setting Floorp Portable as the default browser, a workaround exists using a .bat script.**

This method involves creating a Batch file (.bat) containing the necessary information to register Floorp Portable as the default web browser handler.

After downloading the Batch file, place it in the same directory where floorp.exe is located (the Floorp portable directory) and execute it.

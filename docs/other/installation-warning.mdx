When launching the installer for Floorp for Windows, you may see the message “Windows protected your PC." This is a false positive detection by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen.
Floorp increases transparency by making all source code publicly available and using GitHub Actions for builds.
Ablaze has not implemented this countermeasure because it requires an annual signature fee of ¥100,000 (about $650) or more and corporate registration.
We apologize for any inconvenience and concern this may cause and thank you for your understanding.

## 1. Check Exisiting Issue
Before submitting, check existing issues as there might already be a solution.
Duplicate issues can slow down the resolution process.

Refer to the [Issue Tracker](/docs/issue-tracker) in this documentation as well.

## 2. Verify the Problem in a Vanilla Environment
Your browser environment might be causing the issue. Follow these steps:
- **Update to the Latest Floorp**

  The problem may be resolved in the latest version.\
  Please check if you are using the latest Floorp.

- **Disable All Browser Extensions/Add-ons**

  The problem could be caused by a conflict between Floorp and some add-ons.\
  If the issue is resolved after disabling add-ons, please contact the add-on developer or find an alternative add-on.

- **Clear the Browser Cache and Cookies**

  The problem could be caused by the browser cache.

- **Create a New Profile**

  A "profile" is a browser's management mechanism to separate your settings, logs, etc.\
  The problem could be caused by changes in data handling in the program, especially after updating Floorp.

## 3. Check if the Problem is Specific to Floorp

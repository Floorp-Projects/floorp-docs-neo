## Where to Submit an Issue
Submit issues to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Floorp-Projects/Floorp/issues) or [Official Discord](https://discord.floorp.app) `#en-bugs` channel.

If unsure whether your problem qualifies as an issue, you can ask on Reddit [r/Floorp](https://old.reddit.com/r/floorp) or in [Floorp Projects](https://discord.floorp.app) Discord.\
If on Reddit, please review [Do not post Issues or Feature Requests in Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Floorp/comments/19f7762/do_not_post_issues_or_feature_requests_in_reddit/).


:::note

Questions to the community are for validation, not official issue submission.

The GitHub repository is currently only accepting issues related to Floorp 12.

:::

## 1. Check Existing Issue
Before submitting, check existing issues as there might already be a solution.
Duplicate issues can slow down the resolution process.

Refer to the [Issue Tracker](/docs/issue-tracker) in this documentation as well.

## 2. Verify the Problem in a Vanilla Environment
Your browser environment might be causing the issue. Follow these steps:
- **Update to the Latest Floorp**

  The problem may be resolved in the latest version.\
  Please check if you are using the latest Floorp.

- **Disable All Browser Extensions/Add-ons**

  The problem could be caused by a conflict between Floorp and some add-ons.\
  If the issue is resolved after disabling add-ons, please contact the add-on developer or find an alternative add-on.

- **Clear the Browser Cache and Cookies**

  The problem could be caused by the browser cache.

- **Create a New Profile**

  A "profile" is a browser's management mechanism to separate your settings, logs, etc.\
  The problem could be caused by changes in data handling in the program, especially after updating Floorp.

  [Firefox's profile manager documentation can be found here!](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles)

## 3. Check if the Problem is Specific to Floorp

- **Check if the Problem Occurs in the Latest Firefox ESR**

  Floorp is based on the Firefox ESR version (Extended Support Release).\
  Please check if the problem occurs in Firefox ESR.
  If the problem occurs in Firefox ESR too, please submit the issue to Mozilla, the organization behind Firefox.

  You don't need to check if the problem is related to a Floorp-specific feature.

## 4. After All Checks Are Done

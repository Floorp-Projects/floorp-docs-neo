## Development and Research Focused

Floorp actively pursues experimental browser development.

We have implemented many challenging features by adopting new technologies and ideas.\
As a browser derived from Firefox, Floorp has achieved several industry firsts for browsers of its kind. By releasing these as open source, we contribute to the community from our unique perspective.

## Together with the Community

Floorp is a browser that is constantly improved based on feedback from the community.

We listen to users and work daily to improve Floorp. While we cannot fulfill every request, we respect the community and strive to reflect as many suggestions as possible.

## Project Members (Including You!)

The Floorp project consists of the Floorp team and contributors.

- **Admins** are members who manage the Floorp project and mainly decide its direction.
- **Moderators (Floorp Team)** are members who manage the project and community. Administrators are also part of the moderators.
- **Verified Developers** are developers especially trusted by the Floorp team. Except for having access to a bit more information, their privileges are not significantly different from regular contributors.

Anyone who contributes to Floorp in any way is considered a **contributor**. This includes submitting code, improving documentation, helping with localization, and more.

## Built on the Open

Floorp Browser is open source. All source code is published and can be viewed by anyone.
You can always check what is included and how it works. 
We follow the spirit of open source and welcome contributions from the community through [development, translation, and feedback](docs/other/join.mdx).

## Choices That Matter to You

Floorp values your choices and puts you at the center. 
You can enable or disable many features, and for important choices, Floorp will clearly ask for your permission.

Floorp enables more advanced customization than standard browsers, offering flexibility while maintaining security and privacy. 
It's designed in a way that anyone can easily adjust their browsing experience to their preferences.

## Aiming for a Sustainable Web

Floorp contributes to building an open and sustainable web ecosystem. 
We consider both the web and its users, aiming for a web that benefits everyone and respects user privacy.  

Let's create the future of the internet together!
